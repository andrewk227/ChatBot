# ChatBot
A tiny teachable ChatBot that learns from the user input and make a response with high accuracy.

It works by adding to it some questions and putting them into its Knowlodge base (database.json),
if the bot doesn't find the question in his knowlodge base he will asks you to answer the question and he will automatically put the question with your answer in his database.
